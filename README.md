# Torah Library Add-On for Google Docs

A Google Docs add-on that brings Sefaria-powered source finding, previewing, insertion, linking, and formatting into Google Docs.

> This is not an official Sefaria project.

## Contributing (human or AI)

Before editing anything beyond a typo, read **[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)** (also duplicated as `CLAUDE.md`). It covers: what this codebase actually is, the non-negotiable rules, the anti-pattern catalog, and where the canonical documents live. Companion docs:

- [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) — server/client boundary, storage layers, RPC surface, include graph.
- [`docs/regression-log.md`](./docs/regression-log.md) — every bug that has regressed silently, with the pinning test now holding it down.
- [`docs/rpc-surface.json`](./docs/rpc-surface.json) — the frozen list of server functions reachable from the client.

## Project overview

This repository contains the Google Apps Script code and add-on UI templates used to:

- find a Sefaria source by reference, title, nested path, or phrase,
- preview the selected source before insertion,
- insert Source, Translation, or Source with Translation into the active Google Doc,
- configure Hebrew/translation display and formatting preferences,
- link inserted or existing references to Sefaria,
- apply divine-name transformation preferences, and
- manage user preferences through persistent `PropertiesService` settings.

The codebase is intentionally lightweight and Apps Script-native, without trying to emulate Google Docs APIs locally.

## Main features
See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](./docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a fuller summary of changes and [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for the repository license.

### Unified Find & Insert workflow

The add-on now centers on a unified **Find & Insert Source** sidebar that combines direct lookup and search into a single workflow:

1. find a source by reference, title, nested path, phrase, or Sefaria URL,
2. select a result,
3. configure display/layout/options,
4. preview it,
5. insert it into the current Google Doc.

The sidebar groups results into:

- **Library matches** first
- **Search results** second

### Display and layout controls

The unified sidebar supports:

- **Source**
- **Translation**
- **Source with Translation**

For bilingual insertion, layout options include:

- **Hebrew on top**
- **Hebrew left**
- **Hebrew right**

### Hebrew formatting controls

The unified sidebar includes visible Hebrew formatting controls for:

- **Vowels**
- **Cantillation**

Advanced source-edition/version controls remain available for cases where a specific source edition is needed.

### Translation/version handling

The add-on supports:

- version-aware translation selection,
- improved translation label handling,
- translation filtering,
- language-aware translation display labels,
- optional translation details/attribution in inserted output.

### Linking features

The add-on supports:

- **Insert Sefaria link** for inserted content,
- **Open on Sefaria** for the currently selected result,
- **Link Texts with Sefaria** as a document-level action for turning recognizable references in the current Doc into Sefaria hyperlinks.

### Preferences

Persistent user preferences include:

- orthography controls,
- divine-name transformation controls,
- Hebrew font and font size defaults,
- Translation font and font size defaults,
- optional English divine-name replacement,
- preference-gated legacy features such as Popcorn.

### Structural-node handling

When a selected result is a non-leaf or structural node rather than directly insertable text, the sidebar now provides clearer guidance and keeps insertion disabled until a text-bearing node is selected.

## Key enhancements in this fork

This fork substantially expands the original add-on workflow, including:

- replacing the older split insertion/search flow with a unified sidebar,
- improving search-result selection and preview behavior,
- adding bilingual layout controls,
- surfacing Vowels and Cantillation controls,
- improving translation/version selection UX,
- adding linking workflows,
- adding typography preferences,
- improving divine-name workflows,
- improving structural-node guidance and preview clarity.

See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](./docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a fuller summary of changes and [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for the repository license.

## Translation details / attribution

When Translation text is inserted, the add-on can optionally append a compact translation details block.

Behavior summary:

1. Translation details are only relevant when Translation is inserted (Translation-only or bilingual output).
2. The formatter first uses `data.versionSource` when present.
3. If missing, it falls back to matching `data.versions`.
4. If no source is found, it still emits a version-title-only block when possible.
5. If no usable translation version title is available, no translation-details block is inserted.

## Menu actions

The add-on menu includes:

- **Find & Insert Source**
- **Transform Divine Names**
- **Link Texts with Sefaria**
- **Preferences**
- **Support**
- **Popcorn** (legacy/original-developer feature, preference-gated)

### Apps Script implementation

All Google Apps Script source files now live under `apps-script/`:

- `apps-script/Code.gs` - Main Apps Script server logic (menu setup, Sefaria API calls, insertion, linking, preferences, divine-name transforms, typography application).
- `apps-script/appsscript.json` - Apps Script project manifest.
- `apps-script/attribution.js` - Pure helper module for translation/source attribution logic.
- `apps-script/consts.gs` - Constants and supporting data.
- `apps-script/main.html` - Unified Find & Insert sidebar UI.
- `apps-script/preferences.html` - Preferences dialog UI.
- `apps-script/release-notes.html` - Release notes modal.
- `apps-script/support-and-features.html` - Support/feature request modal.
- `apps-script/popcorn.html` - Legacy/original-developer Popcorn feature UI.
- `apps-script/search.html` - Legacy search UI retained only as historical/reference material if still present.
- `apps-script/package.json` - Local package metadata for lightweight test tooling.

### Documentation

- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Summary of major enhancements in this fork.
- `docs/google-docs-walkthrough.md` - End-user walkthrough for the current unified workflow.

### Tests
- `test/tests/attribution.test.js` - Lightweight local unit tests for attribution formatting/fallback behavior.
- `test/tests/hebrew-preferences.test.js` - Hebrew display preference and divine-name replacement tests (runs `applyHebrewDisplayPreferences` / `applyHebrewDivineNamePreferences` against the real `Code.gs` via `vm`).
- `test/ui/*.test.js` - Lightweight template / contract / snapshot tests for the sidebar and dialog entry points.
- Run everything with `npm test` from the repo root.

## Development workflow

### 1) Make a focused change

- Keep changes small and PR-friendly.
- Prefer pure helpers for logic that can be tested outside Google Docs APIs.
- Avoid adding local infrastructure that tries to emulate `DocumentApp`.

### 2) Run local unit tests

Prerequisite: Node.js 18+ (for built-in `node:test`).

```bash
npm test
```

Current local tests are intentionally lightweight and cover pure logic only.

### 3) Manual validation in Apps Script

Before opening a PR against the production add-on repo, validate in a separate Apps Script test project and a non-production Google Doc.

Recommended manual validation includes:

- unified search/find flow works,
- result selection and collapse behavior works,
- Source / Translation / Source with Translation insertion works,
- bilingual layout options work,
- Vowels / Cantillation toggles work,
- translation details behavior works,
- linking features work,
- preferences persist and affect insertion correctly,
- divine-name transforms behave as expected.


### 4) Local testing details

Current local tests intentionally cover only pure logic such as:

- attribution formatting,
- source fallback resolution,
- empty/edge input behavior.

They do **not** attempt to emulate Google Docs `DocumentApp`, cursor behavior, selection behavior, or table insertion APIs.

This keeps local testing fast and maintainable while still guarding against regressions in isolated logic.

### 5) Contribution guidelines

Open small, reviewable PRs where possible.

Include:

- what changed,
- why,
- local test results,
- manual validation notes.

For formatting or insertion changes, include before/after examples or screenshots when possible.

# Add-on UI Refactor Pack

This pack contains guardrails, a migration checklist, test scaffolding, and a package.json script snippet to help Codex refactor your Apps Script add-on UI without drifting from your existing UX.

## Files included

- `docs/ui-refactor-guardrails.md`
- `docs/ui-refactor-checklist.md`
- `tests/validate-html-includes.mjs`
- `tests/validate-selectors.mjs`
- `tests/validate-page-contracts.mjs`
- `tests/snapshot-page-templates.mjs`
- `tests/fixtures/expected-selectors.json`
- `package-scripts-snippet.json`

## How to use

1. Copy the `docs/` and `tests/` folders into your repo.
2. Merge the scripts from `package-scripts-snippet.json` into your existing `package.json`.
3. Adjust `tests/fixtures/expected-selectors.json` to match your actual critical selectors.
4. Run `npm run test:ui-snapshots` once to generate baseline snapshots.
5. After each Codex pass, run `npm run test:ui`.

## Notes

- The selector fixture is intentionally conservative and should be customized to your real contract.
- The snapshot test is structure-oriented, not a visual browser screenshot test.
- The JS contract test will intentionally fail until the shared/page module files exist.
